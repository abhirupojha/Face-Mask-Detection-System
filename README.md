# Face-Mask-Detection-System\\Overview

The Face Mask Detection System is an AI/ML-based solution designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask. The system uses deep learning models to classify images or video streams into masked and unmasked categories, enhancing public safety and compliance with health regulations.

Features:-

Real-Time Detection: Identifies mask usage in live video feeds.

High Accuracy: Trained on diverse datasets to improve performance.

Scalability: Can be deployed on edge devices like Raspberry Pi or cloud servers.

Multi-Person Detection: Works in crowded environments.

Alerts & Notifications: Generates warnings for non-compliance.

Technologies Used:-

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

OpenCV (for image processing)

TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)

Scikit-Learn (for ML techniques)

Flask/Django (for web API development)

Streamlit (for visualization)

Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL

Deployment: Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure
